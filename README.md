# Drop In SCSS (WIP)

As the title suggested, this collection of SCSS components is meant for dropping in, rather than serving as a framework.  
A lot of exiting front end frameworks are meant for developers to put up a working app quickly, reducing dev time spent on tweeking the pixels and typography.  

But when a designer is brought to a project later on, often she will have to battle with predefined UI patterns set by the framework that the developers have chosen to use.

As a designer who wants to prototype fast and avoid framework dependency, I started to collect those repeatedly written SCSS components. I put this out there for other designers who regularly write stylesheet code to prototype. The files here are only providing barebone support to get started:

- Grid: 12-column grid with configurable gutter width. 
- Helpers: spacing, radius and text helpers that help quickly set up the look and feel.
- Colors: Define 5 brand colors and 5 accent colors, and you're ready to go.
- Other standard UI components, such as buttons, forms, tables, navbar... etc.
